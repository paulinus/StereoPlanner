  <h1>StereoPlanner</h1>
  <p>StereoPlanner is a simple application for stereoscopic photography that allows you quickly check that things will look fine on screen before you shoot.  The calculator will compute roundness and parallax budget given the parameters of the shooting. Set up your focal length, convergence and interaxial and see the roundness and parallax that you will get on screen.</p>

  <p>The upper part of the screen shows the roundness and the minimum, total and maximum parallax as percentage of the screen size and in millimeters. Red numbers will indicates excessive parallax.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>The <b>roundness</b> factor indicates how round or flat the objects will appear on screen.  A roundness factor of 1 indicates perfect roundness where objects will appear on screen as round as they are in reality. Smaller roundness indicates will appear flatter than they are.  Larger roundness indicates that objects will appear elongated much like a football.</li>
      
    <li>The <b>minimum parallax</b> is the parallax of the object that will appear closest to the spectator. This is usually negative and, as a general rule, it should be smaller than 3% of the screen size and 65mm, which corresponds to placing the objects halfway between the screen and the spectator.</li>

    <li>The <b>maximum parallax</b> is the parallax of the object that will appear farthest to the spectator. As a general rule, this should not exceed the distance between the eyes (65mm), or a 3% of the screen size.</li>

    <li>The <b>parallax budget</b> is the difference between the maximum and the minimum parallax and tells you the amount of depth that is present in a shot. Minimum and maximum parallax can be shifted by re-converging the shot in post-production, but the parallax budget will remain constant.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>In the lower part of the screen, a set of sliders let you set up the shooting parameters.</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li> <b>Foreground</b>: the distance from the cameras to the closest object.</li>

    <li> <b>Background</b>: the distance from the cameras to the farthest object.</li>

    <li> <b>Convergence</b>: the distance at which the cameras converge. If you shoot with parallel cameras and set convergence in post-production, put here the distance to the object that will be at zero parallax after post.</li>

    <li> <b>Interaxial</b>: distance between the optical centers of the cameras---also called interocular, baseline or stereo base. At the right of the slider the <b>Max</b> label indicates the larger interaxial that can be used without generating excessive parallax.</li>

    <li> <b>Focal length</b>: the focal length of the lenses. Put the actual focal length (not equivalences) and make sure you set the correct sensor size in the settings.</li>

    <li> <b>Screen width</b>: the width of the screen that you are targeting. If in doubt, put the larger screen size that you plan the material to be shown with.</li>
  </ul>
